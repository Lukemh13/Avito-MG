MEMORY GAME 
Pure and Simple - but not too easy
30 second counter - to remember the Cards 
10 seconds left - pay attention
8 Pairs of emojis - light on memory - no additional resources
Single Player Only - for when you are bored, but your friends can help

## 1st
i worked on the card first, defining a card element within a game board, an array of our emojis is shuffled with the use of shuffleArray(), from which each card is given it's unique emoji at the start of every game.

## 2nd
two of the key functions were flipCard() & checkMatch(), they form the most basic form of game logic, showCards() & hideCards() work for the initial part (first 30 seconds), where the user must remember the cards.

## 3rd
createGameBoard() puts the functions cited above to use, initializing the variables that keep track of the flipped cards, matched cards, countdown & score, to maintain proper game logic.

## 4th 
the styling is basic, i figured simplicity with the emojis is enough, only the use of the original digital timer - retro game style.

## 5th
the game felt nostalgic, so i decided to keep it simple even after tinkering with extra ideas (loading screen, extra animations... etc), we all have a different idea of it but we all played it, i wanted my version to bring up that nostalgia through simplicity.

!! the emojis render differently from browser to browser, i tested on Chrome, Firefox, Brave ... they all seemed good !!
